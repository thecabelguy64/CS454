# NM Housing

Many people, especially youths, have complained that their lives are more difficult than older
generations. Is this just a mere conjecture or does it have a statistical merit? In this code,
we will try to answer this question by analyzing the data to determine how difficult or easy it is
to afford a house between any two years.
This assignment is designed for you to develop just one big program named nm.py. The program
loads (i.e., reads) 3 datasets: (1) Median Household Income in New Mexico; (2) All-Transactions
House Price Index for New Mexico; and (3) Consumer Price Index: All Items for the United States.
It takes 2 inputs from the user: (1) base year; and (2) target year. Then, it produces a line chart
that shows rates of change of the data (in the 3 datasets) in each year when compared to the
base year. It also shows quantitatively, in the chart, how much harder/easier it is to afford a house
in the target year when compared to the base year.
